# INET4031 - Module 6 - Working with Remote Systems

# inet4031-lab4-website

This is my Lab 4 project for INET4031.  

The goal of this project is to show how **HTML** and **JavaScript** work in a web page.  
- The HTML sets up how the page looks.  
- The JavaScript makes the page do things, like turn the lightbulb on and off.  

I updated the page so it has my name, a new background color, and text that explains what is happening.
